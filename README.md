# GS_CO_FirstOpenGLProject
This is a repository for an old college project in which I try to do something with OpenGL for the first time :)

## Game

I implemented a very simple FPS with some frogs that hunt you down inside a box-like environment. The keys used are:

- WASD: Movement, as always.
- Mouse: Shooting, as always.
- R: Reload, you guessed it.
- P: Pause and see the scene from the top of the map, this one was not that easy huh :P
